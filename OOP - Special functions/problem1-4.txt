1. Magic or Special methods in python are built in methods that start and end with 2 underscores.
    These functions can also be overridden for more specific usage

    examples:
    __str__ -> for printing
    __init__ -> constructor
    __ceil__ -> is like doing math.ceil()
    __abs__ -> returns the absolute value

2. If we were to print an object from a class without overriding the __str__ method,
    it will use the default __str__ method which will just return the objects address in a string.
    <__main__.Ob2 object at 0x01EC8490>

3. The __eq__ method is just like writing == in your code. If you were to use the default __eq__ method on 2 different objects
    it would try and see if they are the same address in the memory
