1. A function is a block of code that can be called and reused an endless amount of times. We usually use functions to avoid repeating code.

2. A return value in a function returns a value, object or anything that the developer wants to the place that it was called from.
for example:

def calc_sum(x, y):
    sum = x + y
    return sum


sum = calc_sum(5, 3)
print(sum)

#return value = 8

Here we can see that we give the function calc_sum 2 parameters and it return those values summed together.


3. Pass by value means that a copy of the data is passed to the function and not the address,
   meaning anything that you chance inside of the function wont affect the original data (since not a reference)

   Pass by reference is when you pass the address to the variable this means that if you change it in a function it changes
   in all places (chances the value in spot address) 


4. Scope is where a variable is reachable and accessible. for example:

def top_func():
    x = 5 #the variable x is inside the scope of the top_func.

print(x)

Here were trying to print x but we wont be able to because x is not in our scope.

A variable gets deleted with the function so once you run the function anything inside the scope of the function well be deleted
when the function gets deleted.

A scope ends when you leave a level of indentation for example

x = 10
for i in array:
    i < 10
    print(f"{i} is smaller then 10")

if i > 100:
    return False

Here we try to use 'i' in the if block but we wont be able to due to the fact that the variable 'i' is not in the scope 
and also was deleted with the function

Theres also a global scope which is a variable that is defined at the top level of the code where all functions can 
access that variable
