a. Sockets is a way to communicate with a server in real time. Instead of the server always asking if there's an update from the client side or the other way around, we get notified when there's an update
this helps save time and is almost instant. Sockets are connected with each-other which makes a sort of tunnel and when something gets sent into the tunnel the other side gets notified that something's waiting in the tunnel
We usually would only use sockets when were making real time programs like games or chats.
The alternative to sockets is using requests which is slower but sometimes more efficient when for specific programs

b. First we need to create a socket, then we bind the socket to an IP address and listen for a connection once a connection occurs you need to accept the connection and connect to it from there its send and receive()
the functions that are used:
socket()
bind()
listen()
accept()
connect()
and for sending and receiving data we use send() and recv()
the last thing is the close() function which closes the connection

c. The constructor gets 2 parameters, the first one is address family so an IPv4 or IPv6 aka AF_INET and the second is the type of connection usually TCO or UDP
