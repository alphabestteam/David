1.  Using Ingress will let us expose the port externally and allow HTTP routes from outside the cluster while keeping the inner services isolated.
    It also has the ability to define how HTTP/s traffic should be routed to our services and can handle load balancing.

    Another thing we should do is instead of using NodePort to expose our service we should use ClusterIP.
    ClusterIP service exposes the service within the cluster which pairs perfectly with Ingress since Ingress exposes the port externally.

    The reason we use Ingress and ClusterIP over NodePort is because NodePort has limitations and security issues.
    It also doesn't know how to deal with LoadBalancer.
