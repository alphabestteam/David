1. IntegerField is the correct choice for the model field type.

2. We need to change the value in the models.py from DecimalField to IntegerField so that we can have an Int number as salary in the DB.
   After changing the Field type we create a migration by running 'makemigrations' and that creates a new file in the migrations folder.
   Before we run the 'migrate' command we need to make sure that the DB gets updated so that nothing crashes. To do this we need to create
   a new function inside the migration file that we just created. This function will take the old value (decimal) and round it up to a full number.
   To call this function before the migrate gets called we need to add a RunPython call in the Operations list thats inside the migration file.
   The operation list works in chronological order meaning we need to put the RunPython before the 'AlterField' so that
   we can change the DB values before it migrates.

   Once we've prepared everything we can run migrate.
