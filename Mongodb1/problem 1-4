1. no-sql is a db that uses collections rather then tables meaning it doesnt have the same structure as sql databases

2. no-sql pros:
            simplicity
            easy maintenance
            scalability (easy to change data size and move around with)
   no-sql cons:
            queries are more limited and less flexible
            its less universal since it hasent been around for that long.
            more challenging to find solutions to a complex problem.

3. MongoDB terms/concepts
        database -> Same in sql
            collections -> AKA tables in sql
                documents -> AKA rows in sql
                    fields -> AKA columns in sql

database is where you store all of the data
collections are segments of information that contain columns and rows
documents acts as the rows in no-sql
fields are the keys that you can refer to when trying to receive data

4. The point in having an ID in for every document is so we can locate data that contain the same names.
   IDs are unique and are also implemented into the document by default in case we dont add any IDs of our own.
