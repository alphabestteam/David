1. Docker is a platform that helps developers package and run applications smoothly in a container.

2. A docker image is a set of instructions (built by a DockerFile) and defines how the container should look/work. This is what gives the container
   a structure to work with (Images are usually based off of other Images meaning we dont need to write a fill image from scratch).

   To create a docker image you need to first create a DockerFile with instructions on it then run the following command:
   docker build -t <name:tag> . 
   The . in the end refers to the DockerFile location

3. A Docker container runs on a server and is accessable just like any other server.
   A container is structured based off the image that it was create from and also permaters that were initialized when creating the image.

   To create the container you need to run the command:
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my_nginx nginx
   -d is for Detached, 
   -p means Port
   --name assign the image to the container.

   there are lots more flags that can be used to specifiy things you might need/want to do.

4. Docker image is the structure of which the container needs to work with, whilst an Docker container is what holds the code/dependancies.

5. Environment variables in dockers allows us to pass configuration information to a running container.
   The variables are passed as key and value that can be used by the processes in the container to change how things should work.
   We can do this by writing in the DockerFile ENV "Key" "Value"

6. Volumes give us a way to manage data within the container.
   We can use volimes to share data between my a folder in my PC to the containers file system. (similar to FileZila).
