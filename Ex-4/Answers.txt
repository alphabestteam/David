1.  One of the main issues is if we have lots of varaibles and lots of them go over eachother things start getting messy
    which makes configuring more annoying. Thats where "ConfigMap" object comes in, "ConfigMap" allows us to store varaibles in a seperate file which then
    allows us to use it in multiple places

    If we have lots of variables we want to add and we could use the object "ConfigMap" which allows 
    us to reference the file to get the variables.
    
    Using "Secret" lets us store sensitive information in a secure way.
    So if we have anything we want to keep secure like a password we would place it in a "Secert" object and encode it.
    This is accessable using the "secretRef" keyword then adding - name: filename
