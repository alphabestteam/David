1. WebSocket is a way to send data from client to server and server to client.
It's good for realtime applications since it updates in live time.

2. One of the best things about WebSockets is that it's live meaning it can get updates without refreshing the page.
This is very useful for applications like messages or games since it allows us to receive updates in live without needing
to call any endpoints or refreshing the page.

3. WebSockets transfer string or binary data.

4. Websockets have some disadvantages and limitations.
Websockets are not optimized for streaming audio and video data, they also sometimes have issues with connections since
some environments block websockets connections.
Another limitation that websockets have is that they are stateful meaning its hard to use it in large systems that consist of multiple socket servers.

5. WebSockets work in a very interesting and different way from regular server-client servers, instead of always asking the backend
if there was an update in our application we create a tunnel that connects to both the client and server. Then we can just check if that tunnel
has any data inside waiting to be collected.
If the server wants to send something to the client the server sends it inside the socket and the client can then just check the socket and
get the data. This makes things work in live time and no need to wait or ask the backend every second for updates.

6. The difference between WSS and WebSockets is that WSS is encrypted with TLS connection meaning you need to use https rather than http when using WSS.
