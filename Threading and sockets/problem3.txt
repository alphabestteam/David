a. It's a good way to test things, and it also lets us go between projects that use the same packages with different versions for example if we have 2 different projects that both use the same packages,
but they are on different versions, were going to have problems with the package since it can only be one version at a time. So instead of uninstalling and reinstalling a different version for every
time you change projects you can open a virtual environment and download the version you need then when you switch to the other project you download the version that's required there. Now we have
for each project its own environment with its own packages.

b. it creates a folder that contains all the packages that your project needs. All you need to do after creating it is activate it then your in the virtual env

c. to create a venv (virtual environment) in python you run the command: python -m venv <directory>, then to activate it you run: <directory>\Scripts\activate

d. Yes. I was on a venv this whole time.... But usually you would need to pip install all the packages again that you needed for that project again.
