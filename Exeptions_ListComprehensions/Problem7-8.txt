1. JSON is a format that contains information (usually information inside more information) it's a very popular format
for transferring data from server side and more.

2. To use some json functionality in our python code we need to import json. This will allow us to use multiple functions
that are very useful for when it comes to converting JSON format into python objects.
Main functions from json module:
load() - This function loads the JSON into a python object.
dump() - This function allows us to write to the JSON file using our python objects.
