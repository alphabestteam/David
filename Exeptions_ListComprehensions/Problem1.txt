1. Exceptions is an error that occurs when running a program. If we get an error python generates an exception so we 
    can handle the error correctly(instead of it crashing the program)
    We need to use a try and except block around areas where errors can occur to prevent crashes and 
    handle said exception accordingly
    try:
        int(input("Enter a number)) #as you can see we can fall into a ValueError here because the user
                                    #might enter a letter instead of a number
    
    except ValueError:                  #Here we catch the error and handle it (instead of crashing the program)
        print("an error has occurred")
        handle_error()
