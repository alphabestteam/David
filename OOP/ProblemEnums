1. Enumerators AKA Enums is a set of symbolic names that have unique values attached to them.
    the point in enums is to make the code more readable by using meaningful names instead of meaningless values

2. The biggest reason people use enums is to make the code more readable to anyone. Instead of using numbers we can use
    names that represent the value.
    Example:
    red = FF0000 (hex for red)
    green = 008000 (hex for green)
    blue = 0000FF (hex for blue)

    Here instead of using the hex code for the colors we can simply use the name of the colors which makes it easier to readable
    the code.

    Another pro is that it reduces errors caused by transposing or mistyping numbers.
