1.  To get this info we can run the commands:

    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml -> this command applys 
    the matric server components to our files which lets us access the next command.

    kubectl top pods --namespace=davids-namespace -> This command is what displays all of the pods in the namespace davids-namespace and will show
    the cpu and ram usages per pod.

2.  To set a limit to the cpu and ram usage we can add:
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: <cpuLimit>
            memory: <memoryLimit>
    I personally set it to 20m for cpu and 100mi for memory incase our website gets a lot of traffic im giving extra room for the cpu and ram to grow.
