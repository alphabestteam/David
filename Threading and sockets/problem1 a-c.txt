a. Threads is an operation that runs separately and on its own. Meaning if you have to run two different parts of a program at the same time you would need to separate it into threads for example
if you want to run two different for loops at the same time you would run them in separate threads. This is useful when calculating a lot of information faster another name for this is multithreading.

b. To implement threading in your program you need to import threading.

c. Requests in python allow us to get information using http from servers. It gives us the ability to send and retrieve data from a server. We would want to use requests over sockets when we don't need real
time programming. Wikipedia is an example of where we need requests over sockets
