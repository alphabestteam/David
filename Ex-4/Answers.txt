1.  One of the main issues is if we have lots of varaibles and lots of them go over eachother things start getting messy
    which makes configuring more annoying. Thats where "Secret" object comes in, "Secret" allows us to store varaibles in a seperate file which then
    allows us to use it in multiple places

    If we have lots of variables we want to add and we could use the object "Secret" which allows 
    us to reference the file to get the variables.
    
    Using Secret lets us store sensitive information in a secure way.
    But another very important thing is that it gives us a more comfortable way to store variables and change them
    which allows us to configure variables in multiple places and overall keeps things clean.
