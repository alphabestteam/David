Part1:
    1.  version - what version this docker compose is currently at.

        services - List of all services that we are going to run in this docker compose.
            image - lets us know what image we are using.
            container_name - lets us set a name for that specific container.
            environment - Here we put env values that we would like to set up.
            ports - the port that will be exposed on the web
            volumes - set up volumes and configure where they should be mounted.
                type - defines what type of will be used for the volume.
                source - the source of the volume on our pc.
                target - where we are connecting the volume to in the container.

        volumes - here we define all volumes.

    2.  Error: Cant connect to the server on page localhost:8081 becuase safari cant connect to the server localhost.


    3.  The way to solve this is to add a "ports" attribute with the ports you want this will let us connect to
        the server using that port.
            ports:
              - "8081:8081"


    4. to stop and remove the compose we can run the command: docker-compose down


Part2:
    1.  We can create an .env file to store all the env variables this way we can use them in
        multiple places and change them easily.
