a. Generators are functions that iterates yields. Instead of using return it uses yield to return a value and comes back to continue the code in the function.

b.If we have a very big data sets we would want to use generators
since they don't save anything to the memory.

Pros:
1. You don't need to worry about memory since it doesnt save. It can in theory iterate infinite amount of times
2. Another very interesting thing about generators is that you dont need to wait for the function to return a value
to start using it since it yields an answer every iteration.

c. This way we can make more instances of the generator which also allows us to put in different arguments each time

d. The yield pauses the generator and the value that you send with the yield is returned to the called of the generator
then it goes back to where it stopped and continues the generator functino
