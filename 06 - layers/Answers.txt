1.  Layers lets us update the image based off of what was changed meaning only the places that changes occur that's where
    the updates will be preformed. This saves both time and resources.

2.  The first option is better since it creates fewer layers since for each time you run the RUN command it needs to create a new layer.
    The reason we want fewer layers is to reduce the size of the image.

3.  To find the history of all layers we need to run the command: docker history <image>
