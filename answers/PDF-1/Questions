1. A - Speeds up performance by routing traffic to web servers in a way that increases the overall speed.
   B - open-source
   C - low resource consumption

2. First we go to the conf file and change the port to 8000 (8080 was being used on my pc so needed to change it to 8000 instead)
   Once we change everything we want in the conf file we can run the exe to start the server. Since the root goes straight to the
   html folder then to the index.html all we need to do is replace the existing index with the hello world.

3. Had no issues changing the background color to black or the title to blue.
