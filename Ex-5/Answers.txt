1.  There are two ways to change the amount of pods in your production  
    a. To customize the amount of pods you want in your backend applicaiton you can simply change the amount of replicas: <amount> to a different number.
    
    b. The other way is to do it using the cli using the command: 
    kubectl scale deployment frontend-deployment --replicas=3

3.  The reason we do this is to create more instances of that pod to help with varius things such as traffic.
