a. Recursion is when a function calls itself till it a certain goal is met
b. Most of the time you shouldn't use recursion when coding but in some cases when you 
    want to run a code on itself multiple times you would use it. An example of recursion would
    be factorial this way we can take the value that we got from the function and run it again with the previous value
c. When it comes to speed loops are faster then recursive code. Recursion has to call a function every time which adds 
    more time when running the code as to where looping doesn't need to deal with creating a new function all it does is
    jump back to the beginning of the loop and continue.
