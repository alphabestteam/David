1. Redis is an open source in-memory data structure that stores data in a Key-Value system.

2. Advantages:
    1. In-Memory data - In-Memory means Redis stores data in RAM which makes it super fast for read and write operations.
    2. Performance - Redis is very good when it comes to performance. It was build to handle large number of operations per second.
    3. Easy to use - Redis is very straight and simple to understand.

3. Redis supports a lot of variables:
    Strings
    Hashes
    Lists
    Sets
    Bitmaps
    HyperLogLog
    Geospatial Data

4. Redis has some disadvantages such as:
Memory usage - since it stores data in the memory
single thread - Redis uses a single thread which can become a bottleneck for the CPU
No built-in language - Redis doesn't have a query language like SQL so retrieving data is done through key based operations. This means complex things like join are not supported.
